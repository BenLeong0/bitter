# Bitter

The aim of this project is to create a simplified version of Twitter, as an exercise in full-stack development.

- This repository holds only the frontend

## Project

The stack will consist of:

- React (Frontend)
- Django (Backend)
- PostgreSQL (Database)

While I have experience with JavaScript and Python, this will be my first time building a full-stack application, and my first time using Django. Additionally, this will be my first time implementing SQL knowledge that I have developed but not used before.

## To-do list

- [] Add card to portfolio
- [] Each tweet gets its own page w replies

### Main page

- [x] Resize post box (border cut off)
- [] Profile pics
- [] Interactions counters
- [] Display name + handle link to user page

### User pages

- [] Individual pages for each user
  - [] Display name and banner
  - [] Profile pic
  - [] Banner
  - [] Description

  - [] All their likes?
  - [] All their replies
  - [] Following list
  - [] Follower list
  - [] Edit button on own profile
